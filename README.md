# Final Project: Movie recommendation 

## Purpose
This app is to show the list of movies for users and can filter and search the one they want. It probably involve recommendation part.

## Data set
I am going to use the dataset of movies from IMBD (https://www.kaggle.com/sudheersankar/movie-metadata). 

## Data model
Each movie has multiple genres while one genre can refer to many movies; and one actor can have multiple movies, vice versa. As a result, there are many-to-many relationship.
